# MY Youtube Downloader

- uses [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) tool. This is just a UI for it. 
- This project is primarily for myself. And I haven't tested it on other devices.

## Additional Features:
- Opens a new terminal instance each time, so that the UI is not blocked.
- Ability to resume downloads for playlists. Resumes from x/Total and not from the start.
- Ability to download via external downloader = aria, which is a bit faster.
